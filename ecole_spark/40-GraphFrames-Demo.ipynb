    "[GraphFrames](http://graphframes.github.io/user-guide.html) is a DataFrame-based API that allows you to analyze graph data (social graphs, network graphs, property graphs, etc.), using the power of the Spark\n",
    "cluster. It is the successor to the RDD-based [GraphX](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/graphx-programming-guide.html) API. For an introduction to GraphFrames, see [this blog post](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/03/03/introducing-graphframes.html).\n",
